# "#" is used for comment
#Other than Cucumber there are more BDD Tools 
# Jbehave, Sarenty, Spec flow, Geb Flow
#Feature keyword is used to define the functionality
#Scenario is nothing but the Test Case
#Tagging is done by '@'withTag-Name before scenario
#This tagging is needed to define in RunnerClass with "tags" option setting
#Datadriven Testing is done by passing data for that we use Scenario Outline with Examples:
#So that Each step from scenario will be executed everytime as per the number of times data is passed in Examples:

#Hooks(i.e. @before and @after annotations defined in class that class is called Hooks class) 
# and Hooks are working before and after Feature file 
#Background are working before and after Scenario i.e. within feature file it executes



#Scenario Outline: Login with invalid credentials
#Given user should be on login page
#When user enters invalid <username> and <password>
#Then error message is displayed on login page
#Examples:
#|admin|asdf|
#|admin1|asdf|
#|admin2|asdf|
#|admin3|asdf|
